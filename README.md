# About the Project

An online Polar-Form SVG Path to Rectangular-Form SVG Path Converter.

<img alt="screenshow" src="Screenshots/Screenshot %231.png"/>

# Getting Started

It is still under development, however the conversion works fine!
1. All the symbols like "M,m,L,l" etc. works!
2. The coordinates are supplied like this `M 700 -45d` which translates to `M 494.975 494.975`.
3. The `d` suffix must be supplied for degrees, otherwise radians is assumed. (more support for radians comming soon)
